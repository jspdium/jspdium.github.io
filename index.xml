      <description>A Deductive Reasoning Approach for Database Applications using Verification Conditions I. Alam, R. Halder, and J. S. Pinto. Journal of Systems and Software, 175:110903, 2021. Elsevier

This paper proposes a comprehensive set of Verification Conditions (VCs) generation techniques from database programs, adapting Symbolic Execution, Conditional Normal Form, and Weakest Precondition. The validity checking of the generated VCs for a database program determines its correctness w.r.t. the annotated database properties.</description>

      <description>With Cláudio Lourenço I am investigating the use of Why3 to verify safety properties of TLA specifications (without temporal operators). We have successfuly verified the Paxos consensus algorithm, following Lamport&amp;rsquo;s refinement of the abstract Voting protocol. We will report on this soon.</description>

      <description>An exercise in meta-verification with Why3. This unpublished paper, co-authored with Maria João Frade, is dedicated to our colleague Luís Soares Barbosa, on the occasion of his 60th birthday.
With the incresasing importance of program verification, an issue that has been receiving more attention is the certification of verification tools, addressing the question: “Who verifies the verifier?”.
We approach this meta-verification problem by considering a fundamental component of program verifiers: the “Verification Conditions Generator” (VCGen), responsible for producing a set of proof obligations from a program and a specification.</description>

      <description>The Way of Harmonious Distributed System Proofs. In this ESOP&#39;22 paper jointly written with Cláudio Belo Lourenço, we study principles and models for reasoning inductively about properties of distributed systems, based on programmed atomic handlers equipped with contracts. We present the Why3-do library, leveraging a state of the art software verifier for reasoning about distributed systems based on our models, and illustrate its use with a number of examples involving invariants containing existential and nested quantifiers (including Dijsktra’s self-stabilizing systems).</description>
